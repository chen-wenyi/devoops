# Zustand

## Overview
Zustand has been gaining popularity as a state management library for React applications. 
Its simplicity, minimal boilerplate, and seamless integration with React Hooks have made it an attractive alternative to more established libraries like Redux.

## Quick Setup

#### Define
```tsx
type bearStoreState = { bears: number };

type bearStoreActions = {
  addABear: () => void;
};

type StoreState = bearStoreState & bearStoreActions;

export const useBearStore = create<StoreState>()((set, get) => ({
  bears: 0,
  addABear: () => set({ bears: get().bears + 1 }),
}));
```

#### Usage
```tsx
const bear = useBearStore((state) => state.bears);
const addABear = useBearStore((state) => state.addABear);
```

## Slicing the store into smaller bearStoreState

#### Define types

```tsx title="typing.ts"
export type BearSlice = {
  bears: number;
  addABear: () => void;
};

export type FishSlice = {
  fishes: number;
  addAFish: () => void;
};

export type StoreState = BearSlice & FishSlice;
```

#### Slices
```ts title="bearSlice.ts.ts"
import { StateCreator } from "zustand";
import { BearSlice, StoreState } from "./typing";

export const createBearSlice: StateCreator<StoreState, [], [], BearSlice> = (
  set,
  get
) => ({
  bears: 0,
  addABear: () => set({ bears: get().bears + 1 }),
});
```

```ts title="fishSlice.ts.ts"
import { StateCreator } from "zustand";
import { FishSlice, StoreState } from "./typing";

export const createFishSlice: StateCreator<StoreState, [], [], FishSlice> = (
  set,
  get
) => ({
  fishes: 0,
  addAFish: () => set({ fishes: get().fishes + 1 }),
});
```

#### Store

```ts title="index.ts"
import { create } from "zustand";
import { createBearSlice } from "./bearSlice";
import { createFishSlice } from "./fishSlice";
import { StoreState } from "./typing";

export const useBearStore = create<StoreState>()((...args) => ({
  ...createBearSlice(...args),
  ...createFishSlice(...args),
}));
```

## Devtools with time-travel debugging

```ts
import { devtools } from "zustand/middleware";

export const useBearStore = create<StoreState>()(
  devtools((...args) => ({
    ...createBearSlice(...args),
    ...createFishSlice(...args),
  }))
);
```

Once your store is configured with the devtools middleware:
	1.	Open your application in a browser.
	2.	Open the Redux DevTools extension in your browser. (You may need to install it if you havenâ€™t already, from the Chrome Extension store).
	3.	You should see your Zustand store appear in the DevTools with actions you can time-travel, inspect, and reset.
